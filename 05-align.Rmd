# Plastome variation

We will use the program GetOrganelle to assemble and plastome for each species
from the genome skimming data we have looked at previously.
Note that to improve analytical speed we have pre-examined and filtered data for you.
The data we will work with for chloroplasts can be found in.....

```
get_organelle_from_reads.py -1 Arabidopsis_simulated.1.fq.gz -2 Arabidopsis_simulated.2.fq.gz -t 1 -o Arabidopsis_simulated.plastome -F embplant_pt -R 10
