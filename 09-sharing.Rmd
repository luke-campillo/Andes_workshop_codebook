# Sharing your results

## Presentation

1. Slides on your study group. Don't forget to convince your uninformed audience that this is the most fascinating group in the world with lots to help up understand about evolution.
2. Slides on the information that isn't known about this group - i.e. the question you will answer. Make sure we're convinced that the question you answer will help us address all those cool questions you raised in 1.
3. Your methods - briefly. Describe the approach, not the steps you take on the computer. Talk about methods, not software.
4. Your tree. Highlight new information.
5. Conclusions. What implications do your results have for evolutionary biology?
