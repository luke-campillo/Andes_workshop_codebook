# Variant Calling

At this point you have aligned the sequencing reads to the reference genome.
Your sam/bam file tells you where each read belongs.
The next step is to go through each base in the genome and figure out what base is at that position in each of your individuals.

"The last step in preparing the reads is to index the bam files. This needs to be done to enable fast access to reads overlapping a given position of the genome. Without the index, if you wanted to access reads at the beginning of chromosome 20, you'd need to read through chromosomes 1-19 until you got there. With many samples or deep coverage, this would be a big problem. The bam index is a map to the bam file that lets you skip around quickly."

sort first??
`samtools index results/*.bam`
