# Getting your data

For this workshop we will be using genome sequence data from a group of Andean plants.
For starters we will take a peak at these data so you know what it looks like before we use standard programs to analyze it.

The sequence data is in a shared folder on this server.
Relative to your home folder you can find the data at
`../shared/Andes_plants/`.

If you cd to that directory and list the contents you can see folders containing files of data.

There are sequence files for 40 individuals grouped into four folders, one for each group, as well as a folder of chloroplast data. 
Start by going to the folder for your assigned group and listing its contents.

You do not want to view these files because they are very large.
If you want to see how large use `ls -lh`.
You are already familiar with the `ls` command for listing the contents of folders.
The dash followed by additional letters are called flags.
The `l` flag indicates that we are listing the contents in long form to provide additional information.
The `h` flag means we'll view the data in human readable format (i.e. with size given in Mb).

Raw data is in the form of zipped fastq files, which are generated by a sequencer. 
You can tell this by the very last bit of the name of the files, which is .fastq.gz (just like you might see Word files labeled as .docx).
Just as a note, you often need to do some cleanup of the data that comes of the sequencer
so you only have high quality data.
We have done this step for you already.
Take a look at a little bit of one file.
The `less` command lets you scroll through the (very large) file. 
`zless` is the `less` command that works on zipped files.

Fastq files contain sets of four lines. 
The first line is the name of the sequence. 
The second line is the sequence. 
The fourth line is the quality of the sequence. 
As you scroll through you should see many sets of four (one for each sequence).

```
zless [].fastq.gz
```

Once you are done scrolling use q (for quit) to get back to your prompt.

Before we look at our large files we are going to practice on a small example file.
Move back to the main `Andes_plants` folder.
List the contents and notice the `example.fastq` file.
For this example I have unzipped it.
You can view the entire contents of the file using the command `cat`.

```
cat example.fastq
```

Alternatively you can use the command `head` to view the first few lines of the file.

```
head example.fastq
```

We can also get a sense of the amount of data by counting the number of lines using the word count command `wc`.

```
wc example.fastq
```

This command tells you the number of lines, words, and characters. If you want to focus just on the number of lines you should use the `l` flag.

```
wc example.fastq
```

If we only want to get the names of the sequences we can search for lines that match a particular pattern and print just those. We search with the command `grep`. The pattern we are searching for is lines that start with @. And then we provide the name of the file. Again, because this is a zipped file we use `zgrep`. Additionally, as before we don't want to print all of these lines. 

```
zgrep '^@' [].fastq
```
