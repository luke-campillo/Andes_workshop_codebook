# Computational skills

The high-performance computer we'll use for our data doesn't have the graphical interface
you usually use (like a PC or Mac).
That means you have to type in your commands - you can't point and click.
This actually has a hidden benefit because it's easy to write down what you did in
a line of text rather than having to try to explain where to click on each step.

Let's start by learning how to log in the our server and run commands without clicking.
If you have a PC you'll need [git-bash](https://gitforwindows.org/). If you have a Mac you can open Terminal (you may need to search for it).

## Log in to the server

You will need to log in to one of our campus high-performance computing clusters.
The one we will use for our work is called Seawulf.
Use the command `ssh` followed by your username (your email) `@seawulf.uri.edu`.
Then type your password (you won't be able to see it).

```
ssh rsschwartz@seawulf.uri.edu
```

Now you are logged in to seawulf.
That means all of your work will be done on this computer (even though it might seem like you are still typing on your own computer).

## Basic navigation

To see the list of files on this computer in your directory do the following:
```
ls
```

This folder might be empty because you haven't put anything here.
Let's start our project by getting organized.
First, you can make a directory to put your scripts in.
We'll write these scripts in a little while, but basically a script is a list of commands that you will give the computer to do all the steps to analyze your data.
To make a directory you need to things - the command to make the directory and the name of that directory.

```
mkdir scripts 
```

To practice, repeat this process but make a directory called `results`.
Now list the files in your current home directory again.
Do you see the two folders you just made?

If you want to check out what is in these folders (they are currently empty but we will add to them later)
you need to change directory with the `cd` command.
Think about these folder just like a filing cabinet.
You started off in your home folder and now you are opening the scripts folder.

```
cd scripts
```

Now to get back to your home folder you can't `cd` and give it a folder name because
the computer will look in your current folder (scripts) for another folder.
Instead you need to tell the computer to "move one level up", going outside the current folder to the one containing it.

```
cd ..
```

We will learn lots more commands as we work through our data.
