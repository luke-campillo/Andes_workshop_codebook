# Genomic data

By definition genomes are large.
The human genome is 3.2 billion base pairs.
If you were to go through and compare two parents and a child by hand to discover the differences between them it would take a while.
To add to this complexity, genomes don't come off the sequencer as a 3.2 billion base pair sequence,
but as millions of small fragments.
Think of this sequencing method as tossing a book (your genome) into a paper shredder.
That means first you have to compare each fragment to a "reference genome" (like the real book)
and then figure out where your genome differs from the reference.
This is definitely a process you don't want to do by hand!

A computer (at least a big one with lots of computing power) can help us out by automating all these comparisons.
That means that before we can identify how the sequence of a child differs from its parents
we need to build some skills to communicate with our large high-performance computer.
