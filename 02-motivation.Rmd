# Data and analysis

## Genomic data

By definition genomes are large.
The human genome is 3.2 billion base pairs.
Plants can be even larger.
If you were to go through and compare two plant genomes by hand to discover the differences between them it would take a while.
To add to this complexity, genomes don't come off the sequencer as a 3.2 billion base pair sequence,
but as millions of small fragments.
Think of this sequencing method as tossing a book (your genome) into a paper shredder.
That means first you have to compare each fragment to a "reference genome" (like the real book)
and then figure out where your genome differs from the reference.
This is definitely a process you don't want to do by hand!

A computer (at least a big one with lots of computing power) can help us out by automating all these comparisons.
That means that before we can identify how the sequence of two plants differ
we need to build some skills to communicate with the server that we are using to work with our data.

## Phylogenies

Different analyses produce different trees.
Different datasets produce different trees.
Rapid diversification makes analyses challenging. 
Divergence dates can be estimated on trees with calibrations.
