"],["genomic-data.html", "Chapter 3 Genomic data", " Chapter 3 Genomic data By definition genomes are large. The human genome is 3.2 billion base pairs. Plants can be even larger. If you were to go through and compare two plant genomes by hand to discover the differences between them it would take a while. To add to this complexity, genomes don’t come off the sequencer as a 3.2 billion base pair sequence, but as millions of small fragments. Think of this sequencing method as tossing a book (your genome) into a paper shredder. That means first you have to compare each fragment to a “reference genome” (like the real book) and then figure out where your genome differs from the reference. This is definitely a process you don’t want to do by hand! A computer (at least a big one with lots of computing power) can help us out by automating all these comparisons. That means that before we can identify how the sequence of two plants differ we need to build some skills to communicate with the server that we are using to work with our data. "],["computational-skills.html", "Chapter 4 Computational skills 4.1 Log in to the server 4.2 Basic navigation", " Chapter 4 Computational skills The high-performance computer we’ll use for our data doesn’t have the graphical interface you usually use (like a PC or Mac). That means you have to type in your commands - you can’t point and click. This actually has a hidden benefit because it’s easy to write down what you did in a line of text rather than having to try to explain where to click on each step. Let’s start by learning how to access our server and run commands without clicking. 4.1 Log in to the server For this duration of this workshop you will have access to a server at the University of Rhode Island. Go to rstudio.uri.edu and log in with the first part of your email address as both the username and password. Click on the Terminal tab to access the command line interface. 4.2 Basic navigation To see the list of files on this computer in your “home” directory do the following: ls This folder might be empty because you haven’t put anything here. Let’s start our project by getting organized. First, you can make a directory to put your scripts in. We’ll write these scripts in a little while, but basically a script is a list of commands that you will give the computer to do all the steps to analyze your data. To make a directory you need two things - the command to make the directory and the name of that directory. mkdir scripts Now we can move into that folder. cd means change directory so we’ll use that a lot to open different folders. This command also has a command and an argument. cd scripts Now to get back to your home folder you can’t cd and give it a folder name because the computer will look in your current folder (scripts) for another folder. Instead you need to tell the computer to “move one level up”, going outside the current folder to the one containing it. cd .. To practice, repeat this process but make a directory called results. Now list the files in your current home directory again. Do you see the two folders you just made? If you want to check out what is in these folders (they are currently empty but we will add to them later) you have two options. First, you can change directory with the cd command and list the contents of the folder with ls. Think about these folder just like a filing cabinet. You started off in your home folder and now you are opening the results folder. Alternatively, list the contents of a folder by given ls the folder name as an argument (e.g. ls scripts). We will learn lots more commands as we work through our data. Adapted from http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/ "],["getting-your-data.html", "Chapter 5 Getting your data", " Chapter 5 Getting your data For this workshop we will be using genome sequence data from a group of Andean plants. For starters we will take a peak at these data so you know what it looks like before we use standard programs to analyze it. The sequence data is in a shared folder on this server. Relative to your home folder you can find the data at ../shared/Andes_plants/. If you cd to that directory and list the contents you can see folders containing files of data. There are sequence files for 40 individuals grouped into four folders, one for each group, as well as a folder of chloroplast data. Start by going to the folder for your assigned group and listing its contents. You do not want to view these files because they are very large. If you want to see how large use ls -lh. You are already familiar with the ls command for listing the contents of folders. The dash followed by additional letters are called flags. The l flag indicates that we are listing the contents in long form to provide additional information. The h flag means we’ll view the data in human readable format (i.e. with size given in Mb). Raw data is in the form of zipped fastq files, which are generated by a sequencer. You can tell this by the very last bit of the name of the files, which is .fastq.gz (just like you might see Word files labeled as .docx). Just as a note, you often need to do some cleanup of the data that comes of the sequencer so you only have high quality data. We have done this step for you already. Take a look at a little bit of one file. The less command lets you scroll through the (very large) file. zless is the less command that works on zipped files. Fastq files contain sets of four lines. The first line is the name of the sequence. The second line is the sequence. The fourth line is the quality of the sequence. As you scroll through you should see many sets of four (one for each sequence). zless [].fastq.gz Once you are done scrolling use q (for quit) to get back to your prompt. Before we look at our large files we are going to practice on a small example file. Move back to the main Andes_plants folder. List the contents and notice the example.fastq file. For this example I have unzipped it. You can view the entire contents of the file using the command cat. cat example.fastq Alternatively you can use the command head to view the first few lines of the file. head example.fastq We can also get a sense of the amount of data by counting the number of lines using the word count command wc. wc example.fastq This command tells you the number of lines, words, and characters. If you want to focus just on the number of lines you should use the l flag. wc -l example.fastq If we only want to get the names of the sequences we can search for lines that match a particular pattern and print just those. We search with the command grep. The pattern we are searching for is lines that start with @. And then we provide the name of the file. grep &#39;^@&#39; example.fastq Because this is a small example file we are able to print all the header lines without it being overwhelming. However, with our larger files we don’t want to do this. However, we know that the head command allows us to view just the first few lines of our output. Now we’ll combine those two commands using a pipe (|). First we enter the grep command (with it’s two arguments) then we “pipe” the output to the head command rather than printing it to the screen. grep &#39;^@&#39; example.fastq | head Notice that the head command does not have arguments in this case because it accepts the output from the grep command. The head command accepts a flag with the number of lines you want to print. For example head -4 will print the first four lines. Your first challenge in this course is to combine the information that you have learned to get the number of header lines in one of your zipped fastq files (using zgrep). 5.0.1 Repeating analyses One approach to analyzing multiple files in the same way is to copy your code and edit each copy to include the name of a particular file. That might be feasible (if slow) for the 10 files you are working with here, but it is inconvenient for the many files you might work with on a larger genomics project. Instead, we can make a list of the files we want to work with and tell the computer to repeat the analysis on each file. In the prior challenge you figured out what analysis you want to do (list the number of header lines). Now we need to learn how to repeat this. In most programming languages, including our command line, we use a loop to go through a list and repeat that command. On the command line the format to do this looks like for thing in list_of_things do command $thing done We start with for to indicate that we are about to make a loop. Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to the variable thing, and the commands inside the loop are executed. Think of a variable as a box that holds the item we are working with. For example, if we are working with a list of files then the first time through the loop thing is the first file name in the list, the second time through thing is the second name, and so on. This allows us to repeat our command for each item in the list using the same variable name. Inside the loop, we indicate the variable by putting $ in front of it. The $ tells the shell interpreter to treat the variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or an external command. Start by figuring out what goes on the third line of the loop Now figure out what goes on the first line (i.e. your list) When you run your loop it should print the number of header lines for each file We might want to add one command to this loop to print out the name of the file prior to printing the number of header lines so we can more easily keep track of each file’s information. The echo command will print whatever comes after it. Try inserting this command into your loop in order to print the name of the file following by the number of header lines. Did you need to list all your files by hand? Copying and pasting a lot of names can be time consuming and error prone. Logically, you want to make your list following a particular rule, for example all of the files in this folder. We can use a wildcard (denoted *) to do this. So instead of writing out all the file names, replace all of that just with * as your list. In other situations keep in mind that we might want to be more precise. * really suggests any number of any character. To indicate all files that end in fastq.gz we could use *fastq.gz as our list. "],["target-capture-data.html", "Chapter 6 Target Capture Data", " Chapter 6 Target Capture Data First make a folder in your home directory to hold your aligned files. mkdir alignment Now we need to run the program to figure out where all those short reads came from in the genome. This is called aligning. However, before we do this, we have to recognize that this process might take a while. Currently we are all logged into the same computer so if we all try to analyze our data on this one computer it will overload the system. Fortunately this computer is part of a computing cluster. That means if we write down our command this computer can send the information to another computer to run our job. Let’s start by making a file that contains our command, which we’ll call a script. nano scripts/alignment_script.sh See how I made my script inside the scripts folder to keep everything organized? That .sh on the end also says something about this file - in this case it is a script that can be run in our computing “shell”. Let’s add the command we need to run to our script bowtie2 -p 20 -x /data3/schwartzlab/rachel/human_teaching/ref/hg38_Ensembl -1 /data3/schwartzlab/human_CEU_trio/NA12878/U0a_CGATGT_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz -2 /data3/schwartzlab/human_CEU_trio/NA12878/U0a_CGATGT_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz -S results/U0a_CGATGT_L001_001.sam What does this command mean? First we have bowtie2, which is the name of the program we are using. Then we have a series of “flags” (they start with -) followed by some information. The -p flag tells you how many processors you get to use. We’ll use 20 processors for this analysis, which means things go a lot faster than on your laptop. The -x flag says what reference genome we want to align to. That’s going to be in /data3/schwartzlab/rachel/human_teaching/ref/ and its name is hg38. Now we list the path to our fastq sequence files with the -1 and -2 flags. And finally we use the -S flag to say where we want our output to go. This file has a .sam extension because that’s what the makers of this program have called this output file format. Now that we have our command we need to add a few things to this script. First we need to add at the top of the file some information for the computer on how it is supposed to run it. The computer needs to know a couple of things, including how many processors you plan to use and how much time you need. This will help the computer allocate computer power to you and share amongst everyone wanting to analyze data. We’ll also have the computer send you an email when the job is done (enter your email address - don’t just copy-paste). #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=20 #SBATCH --time=200:00:00 #SBATCH --mail-user=&lt;your email here&gt; cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR Next, we are running the program bowtie2 so we need to tell the computer to load this program so it can use it. Between your SBATCH commands and your bowtie command add module load Bowtie2/2.3.4.2-foss-2018b Finally, you need to tell the computer that this is a “shell” script. The first line of every script has a “shebang” line that specifies how the computer should interpret the code. #!/bin/sh Exit nano with Ctrl-X and save your script. Now you can tell the computer to run the script. sbatch scripts/alignment_script.sh Now make a copy of the script `cp scripts/alignment_script.sh scripts/alignment_script2.sh`` See how the copy command (cp) takes two arguments: the source and destination. Edit this script so your bowtie command uses the second set of fastq files and produces results with the correct name (note you are changing three file names total). Then copy the command to a new line for the third set of files and so on and so forth. Copying and pasting to analyze all your files will take a while, so later on we will learn how to tell the computer to go through a list of files and analyze them all with the same approach. Computers are great at repeating analyses. Run this script. You can check the output as it goes by printing the contents of the slurm output file. Use ls to get the name of your output file (everyone’s is unique, but it will start with slurm and end with .out). Then use cat (command) and the name of the file (argument) to see its contents. Now you can take a look at one of your output sam files. less results/U0a_CGATGT_L001_001.sam The less command allows you to scroll through the file. Type q to go back to your prompt. This file is in a special format with a lot of information about where each read came from in the reference genome and also how well it aligned to that location. Before we look more closely, did you notice that you are scrolling through a lot of header information before you got to any real data? You can ask the computer to search for and only print files that aren’t header lines. Header lines start with @SQ so that’s what we’ll have the computer print - anything that matches that pattern. The search command is grep. We also need to specify we want lines that don’t start with @SQ. If you are searching for lines that start with @SQ you need that information plus the code for “starts with”, which is ^. Finally you need to specify you want the opposite lines, so you’ll use a “flag” -v. Then you’ll need to add the file name as an argument. Here’s the command but don’t type it yet! This will print out a ton of data. grep -v '^@SQ' results/U0a_CGATGT_L001_001.sam You want to be able to scroll through with less. To do this we are going to the take the output of our grep command and instead of sending it to the cammand line (ie printing everything to the screen), we will “pipe” the output using the | (you can find it above your Enter key) to the less command. grep -v '^@SQ' results/U0a_CGATGT_L001_001.sam |less There’s a lot of information here but don’t worry too much about the details. Each line is just information about where that sequence aligned to the human genome and how well it aligned. These alignments allow other programs to figure out what the sequence is for each base in each individual. These files are rather large, but we can compress them into bam format, which makes them take less space and also makes them easier to work with. You can convert a sam file to a bam file using the following command. samtools view -b -o results/U0a_CGATGT_L001_001_mapped.bam results/U0a_CGATGT_L001_001.sam Rather than type this on the command line (where you will forget what you typed and it won’t work right anyway), make a new script with this command instead of the bowtie command. I advise copying the alignment script (give it a useful name) and put this command in place of the bowtie line. Also add this samtools view command for your other files so that you have 11 lines that look similar except for the input and output filenames. Did you notice how this command has flags and arguments (output then input files) just like other command line commands? The program samtools is a set of tools for working with sam files. The view command loads the file. The o flag sets the name of the output file. The b flag outputs in bam format. All the samtools commands and flags can be found at http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html As before, you need to load a module to access the samtools program. Replace your bowtie module with SAMtools/1.10-GCC-8.3.0. Once all of your alignment scripts are done running, run this script to convert sams to bams. Adapted from https://datacarpentry.org/wrangling-genomics/ "],["variant-calling.html", "Chapter 7 Variant Calling", " Chapter 7 Variant Calling At this point you have aligned the sequencing reads to the reference genome. Your sam/bam file tells you where each read belongs. The next step is to go through each base in the genome and figure out what base is at that position in each of your individuals. “The last step in preparing the reads is to index the bam files. This needs to be done to enable fast access to reads overlapping a given position of the genome. Without the index, if you wanted to access reads at the beginning of chromosome 20, you’d need to read through chromosomes 1-19 until you got there. With many samples or deep coverage, this would be a big problem. The bam index is a map to the bam file that lets you skip around quickly.” sort first?? samtools index results/*.bam TVIEW??
