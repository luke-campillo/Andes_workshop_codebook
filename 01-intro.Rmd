How different are you from your parents?
You might know that half of your DNA comes from each parent.
Despite this 50-50 split you are actually both more and less similar to your parents.
First, approximately 90% of DNA is identical among all humans.
This should make sense because changes to a lot of our DNA would alter our blueprint in a way that might not be successful.
However, two randomly selected people generally only differ less than 0.6% of their genome.
On the other hand, you aren't exactly inheriting half of your DNA from each parent
because some mutations occurred when each parent passed down their DNA.

Based on recent whole genome studies in families, we think that the de novo mutation rate in humans is approximately 1.1 Ã— 10^-8 per haploid genome (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; Roach et al., 2010). By this estimate, an individual's diploid genome harbors, on average, around 64 de novo mutations among 3.2 billion base pairs.  
Keep in mind that is an average.

This tutorial steps through the basic process of finding new mutations in an individual using genome sequence data.
Some of you may work with human genomes, while others work with other species.
