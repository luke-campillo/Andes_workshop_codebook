# Introduction {#intro}

This tutorial steps through the basic process of analyses in evolutionary biology.
We use genome sequence data to build phylogenetic trees.
We then use these phylogenies and trait data to understand...

We will use data from 40 species in the family Campanulaceae.
We will break into groups and each examine a subset of these data.
We will examine different datasets using different approaches to understand how individual datasets contribute to phylogeny estimation.
